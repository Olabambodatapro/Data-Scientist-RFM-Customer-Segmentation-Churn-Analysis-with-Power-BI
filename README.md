RFM Customer Segmentation & Churn Analysis with Power BI
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and performing churn analysis. The dataset is from an online retail store, and the analysis was done using Power BI to:

Calculate RFM scores: Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary (total spending).
Identify churned customers: Defined as customers who have not made a purchase in the last 180 days.
Create interactive visualizations: Including histograms, pie charts, and slicers to filter data based on RFM scores and churn.
The final dashboard allows users to explore customer segments and identify at-risk customers, providing actionable insights for marketing strategies and customer retention.
